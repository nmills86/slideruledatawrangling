## The script cleanuci.R cleans the UCI HAR Dataset, which can be downloaded from this link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## If you extract the zip file to a separate folder, your folder structure should mimic the setup that I have in the 
script. 

## I have also included a codebook and a clean data file.
